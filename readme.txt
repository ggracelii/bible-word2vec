The most similar words for my bible model is vastly different for positive="life", negative="faith" than the most similar words for just "life" whereas the Google model doesn't really change. This exemplifies the emphasis the bible places on faith in relation to life. With faith, life is similar to wisdom, heart, hope, soul, and sins. Without faith, life is reduced to less siginificant ideas, such as "ephraim_shall_return" and "farm".

Additionally, the most similar words for "man" without "woman" and "woman" without "man" for my bible model tend to be more abstract words that don't really connect to the ideas of man and woman, such as "work_therein", "hath_walked", "yellow_gold", and "weavest". This is also the case for "mother" and "father": "receieved_sight", "laid_incense_thereon", "but_oh", and "light_affliction" are among the most similar words. This phenomenon indicates that my bible model is not precise for analogous pairs and context-specific semantic relationships, whereas the Google model can more accurately capture the relationship between people, such as man/woman or mother/father.

Also, my bible model tends to have more phrases in the most similar words. This could be due to the model struggling with abstract analogies or archaic language, whereas the Google model showcases more colloquial language that is common in modern English.
